The code here is an updated and improved version of the game based on viewer submissions via pull requests.  The original code from the challenge itself can be found here:

To submit a new issue, [file an issue describing your idea](https://github.com/CodingRainbow/Asteroids/issues/new) and [make a pull request](https://github.com/CodingRainbow/Asteroids/pulls)! If you make your own version of the game in a separate repo or fork, pull request this README file to add a link.

I'll make a video about how to contribute soon too!
